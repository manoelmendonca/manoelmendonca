# 👋 Hello, I'm Manoel Mendonça!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🚀 Here, you'll find projects, studies, and contributions related to technology and software development.

## 🔥 About Me

I am a **Data Scientist** with a background in Electronic Engineering and a Master's in Quantitative Finance. With over 20 years of experience in programming and data analysis, I transitioned to Data Science in 2023. My focus is on solving business challenges with data-driven insights, leveraging **Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and Predictive Modeling**.

Among my achievements, I was awarded **1st place at the DS Community Hackday**, where I developed a pricing prediction system using Machine Learning. I have experience in **sales forecasting, customer segmentation, and interactive dashboard development** using **Streamlit**.

📌 My academic publications include studies on **dynamic models for forecasting interest rates, judiciary budget analysis, and the impact of taxation on the digital economy**.
